TP Project : Pharmaceutical Stock Management
Develop a program in C language to assist a pharmacy in managing its stock of
medications. The program should allow the user to perform the following operations:

1. Add a new medication to the stock:
- The program should prompt the user to enter the following information for each
medication:
- Medication name
- Available quantity
- Unit price
- Manufacturing date (format DD/MM/YYYY)
- Expiry date (format DD/MM/YYYY)
- Medication brand
- Before adding the medication to the stock, the program should verify that the expiry date
is valid and display a warning if it is near or exceeded.

2. Display the list of medications in stock:
- The program should display all information about each stored medication, including the
name, available quantity, unit price, manufacturing date, expiry date, and brand.

3. Search for a medication by the first characters of its name:

4. Update the available quantity of a medication in stock:
- The program should allow the user to update the available quantity of a specific
medication in the stock.

5. Delete a medication from the stock:
- The user should be able to delete a specific medication from the stock.

The program should provide an interactive menu allowing the user to select these different
options. Ensure proper handling of user inputs and provide appropriate error or warning
messages.
